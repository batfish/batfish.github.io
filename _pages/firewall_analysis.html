Manually reasoning about what an ACL or firewall policy will do to a packet, when it has rules that cover
      multiple fields of the IP header, is extremely difficult and as the rules grow in size becomes virtually
      impossible. Add to that the task of understanding what a change to the ACL or firewall policy will do,
      and you are in for quite a ride.

This is where a tool such as Batfish comes into play. It provides multiple methods of analyzing ACLs and
      firewall rules, so that you can ensure that your security policy functions as desired. And it is built for
      you to do this programmatically, so you can easily incorporate this into any workflow.

Batfish provides 4 core capabilities to analyze an ACL or firewall policy.
<p><br></p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 600;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 600;">testFilters</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 600;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 600;">searchFilters</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 600;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 600;">filterLineReachability</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 600;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 600;">compareFilters</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
This article will show you how to use each of these capabilities to analyze an ACL and a change to an ACL.
      So let’s get started. This article assumes some familiarity with Batfish.
      Please view the <a href="https://www.github.com/batfish/batfish">GitHub</a> page
      and <a href="https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io">docs</a> page for an overview.
<h3>Analyzing the filter behavior for a specific flow</h3>
<i>Note: A detailed Jupyter notebook covering this example can be found </i>
      <a href="https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/linked/analyzing-acls-and-firewall-rules.html"><i>here</i></a>
      <p><br></p>


The <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace; font-weight: 600;"><b>testFilters</b></span> query allows you to analyze the behavior of a filter
      (Firewall policy or ACL rule) with respect to a specific flow. For example, if I want to determine if an ACL
      is allowing a specific host to reach the
      DNS server, I would use <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace; font-weight: 600;"><b>testFilters</b></span> as shown below.
<p><br></p>
<table class="table bf-code table-borderless text-monospace">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<i># Check if a representative host can reach the DNS server</i>
<br>
dns_flow = HeaderConstraints(srcIps="10.10.10.1", dstIps="218.8.104.58",
                    applications=["dns"])
<p><br></p>
answer = bfq.testFilters(headers=dns_flow, nodes="rtr-with-acl",
                    filters="acl_in").answer()
    <p><br></p>
show(answer.frame())
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br></p>

<table class="table bf-table table-striped table-hover table-responsive text-monospace">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Node</th>
<th>Filter name</th>
<th>Flow</th>
<th>Action</th>
<th>Line content</th>
<th>Trace</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>rtr-with-acl</td>
<td>acl_in</td>
<td>Start Location: rtr-with-acl

Src IP: 10.10.10.1

Src Port: 49152

Dst IP: 218.8.104.58

Dst Port: 53

IP Protocol: UDP</td>
<td>PERMIT</td>
<td>660 permit udp 10.10.10.0/24 218.8.104.58/32 eq domain</td>
<td>Matched line 660 permit udp 10.10.10.0/24 218.8.104.58/32 eq domain</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br></p>

With a simple query, you can get a definitive answer about the behavior of a filter with regards to a specific flow.
      So before you make a change to an ACL or firewall rule, you can test the existing one and determine what action
      it takes for a specific flow (or sets of flows).

But if you wanted to analyze the behavior of a filter for a large set of flows, you would use
      <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace; font-weight: 600;"><b>searchFilters</b></span> instead.
<h3>Analyzing the filter behavior for a large set of flows</h3>
<i>Note: A detailed Jupyter notebook covering this example can be found
</i><a href="https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/linked/analyzing-acls-and-firewall-rules.html"><i>here</i></a>
<p><br></p>

Building on the previous example, let’s see if the ACL permits access to the DNS server for ALL hosts in a given subnet.
      To do that, you actually “search” for any DNS flow from the source subnet to the DNS server that is denied.
      You are asking Batfish to see if there are any flows that violate your policy that all hosts in the given
      subnet MUST have access to the DNS server.
<p><br></p>
<table class="table bf-code table-borderless text-monospace">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<i># Check if the subnet can reach the DNS server</i>
<p><br></p>
dns_traffic = HeaderConstraints(srcIps="10.10.10.0/24", dstIps="218.8.104.58", applications=["dns"])
<p><br></p>
answer = bfq.searchFilters(headers=dns_traffic, action"deny", filters="acl_in").answer()
<p><br></p>
show(answer.frame())
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br></p>
<table class="table bf-table table-striped table-hover table-responsive text-monospace">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Node</th>
<th>Filter name</th>
<th>Flow</th>
<th>Action</th>
<th>Line content</th>
<th>Trace</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr >
<td>rtr-with-acl</td>
<td>acl_in</td>
<td>Start Location: rtr-with-acl

Src IP: 10.10.10.42

Src Port: 49152

Dst IP: 218.8.104.58

Dst Port: 53

IP Protocol: UDP</td>
<td>DENY</td>
<td>460 deny udp 10.10.10.42/32 218.8.104.58/32 eq domain</td>
<td>Matched line 460 deny udp 10.10.10.42/32 218.8.104.58/32 eq domain</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br></p>

As you can see, we did get a flow that matches the search condition and thus violates our desired guarantee of the
      entire subnet being able to reach the DNS server. The columns carry the same information as those for
      <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace; font-weight: 600;"><b>testFilters</b></span> and provide insight
      into the violation. In particular, we see that a flow with source IP 10.10.10.42 is denied by an earlier line
      in the ACL. Such needles in the haystack are impossible to find with other tools and techniques.

Both <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace; font-weight: 600;"><b>testFilters</b></span> and
      <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace; font-weight: 600;"><b>searchFilters</b></span> help you analyze
      the behavior of an ACL or firewall rule with regards to a given flow or sets of flows. But Batfish provides
      another interesting capability to analyze a filter -
      <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace; font-weight: 600;"><b>filterLineReachability</b></span>.
<h3>Identifying unreachable filter lines</h3>
<i>Note: A detailed Jupyter notebook covering this example can be found </i><a href="https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/linked/analyzing-acls-and-firewall-rules.html"><i>here</i></a>
<p><br></p>

What once started out as a nice pristine and easy to understand ACL or firewall policy, over time turns into quite a
      mess as the network and services evolve. Oftentimes, you end up creating new rules that are partially or fully
      masked by earlier rules, thereby rendering your changes partially and wholly ineffective.
      To help you in this situation, Batfish has the query
      <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace; font-weight: 600;"><b>filterLineReachability</b></span>.
<p><br></p>
<table class="table bf-code table-borderless text-monospace" >
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<i># Find unreachable lines in filters of rtr-with-acl</i><p><br></p>
aclAns = bfq.filterLineReachability(nodes="rtr-with-acl").answer()
<p><br></p>
show(aclAns.frame())
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br></p>
<table class="table bf-table table-striped table-hover table-responsive text-monospace" >
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Sources</th>
<th>Unreachable line</th>
<th>Unreachable line action</th>
<th>Blocking lines</th>
<th>Different action</th>
<th>Reason</th>
<th>Additional info</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>rtr-with-acl: acl_in</td>
<td>670 permit ip 166.146.58.184 any</td>
<td>PERMIT</td>
<td>540 deny ip 166.144.0.0/12 any</td>
<td>True</td>
<td>BLOCKING_LINES</td>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>rtr-with-acl: acl_in</td>
<td>790 deny ip 54.203.159.1/32 any</td>
<td>DENY</td>
<td>500 deny ip 54.0.0.0/8 any</td>
<td>False</td>
<td>BLOCKING_LINES</td>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br></p>
Each line in the answer above identifies an unreachable line in a filter. Let’s take a closer look at the first one.
      It shows that the <span>line 670 permit ip 166.146.58.184 any</span> is unreachable because it is blocked by the
      <span>line 540</span> shown in the <span>Blocking_Lines</span> column. The <span>Different_Action</span> column
      indicates that the blocking <span>line 540</span> has the opposite action as the blocked <span>line 670</span>,
      a more worrisome situation than if actions were the same.
The <span>Reason</span> column shows that the line is unreachable because it has other lines that block it,
      Lines can also be independently unreachable (i.e., no packet will ever match it) or may be unreachable
      because of circular references.
      The <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace; font-weight: 600;"><b>filterLineReachability</b></span>
      question identifies such cases as well, and provides more information about them in the <span>Additional_Info</span>
      column.

<h3>Comparing the behavior of filters</h3>
<i>Note: A detailed Jupyter notebook covering this example can be found </i><a href="https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/linked/safely-refactoring-acls-and-firewall-rules.html"><i>here</i></a>
      <p><br></p>

As your network evolves, the ACL and firewall policies change and grow, often resulting in large rule-sets that can
      exceed the capability of the specific device it is applied to, or result in a performance degradation.
      So you periodically try to refactor / compress these rules to mitigate this problem.
      The <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace; font-weight: 600;"><b>compareFilters</b></span> query in
      Batfish allows you to compare the behaviors of your existing ACL/firewall policy and the new compressed one to
      ensure that you are not permitting or denying more traffic than desired.

      <p><br></p>
The <span style="font-family: monospace, monospace; font-weight: 600;"><b>compareFilters</b></span> question
      compares two filters and returns pairs of lines, one from each filter, that match the same flow(s) but treat
      them differently. If it reports no output, the filters are guaranteed to be identical.
      The analysis is exhaustive and considers all possible flows.

As we can see from the output above, our compressed ACL is not the same as the original one.
      In particular, <span>line 210</span> of the compressed ACL will deny some flows that were being permitted by
      <span>line 510</span> of the original; and <span>line 510</span> of the compressed ACL will permit some flows
      that were being denied by <span>line 220</span> of the original ACL. Because the permit statements correspond
      to ICMP traffic, we can tell that the traffic treated by the two filters is ICMP. To narrow things down to
      specific source and destination IPs that are impacted, you can run the
      <span style="font-family:monospace, monospace; font-weight: 600;"><b>searchFilters</b></span> query.
