We are proud to announce **Batfish AI-ML®**, our latest product. Batfish AI-ML, or Automatic Intent Mind Link, is the **industry’s first and only automatic intent extraction solution.** It works seamlessly across all networks, be they data centers, enterprise campuses, service provider networks, or hybrid and multi-cloud deployments.

## Why Batfish AI-ML?

Network engineers have told us repeatedly that the hardest part of intent-based networking (IBN) is intent specification. Knowing in their heads what the network should do is one thing, but telling that to a machine, also called programming in some circles, is an entirely different ballgame. The difficulty of this task renders IBN almost pointless.

That all changes now because Batfish AI-ML dispenses the need for intent specification. All network engineers have to do is to _think_ about the policies their network is intended to meet. Batfish AI-ML will automatically extract network intents from their thoughts. The further this thinking is from the painstaking complexity of the real network, the better. Network engineers no longer have to fight YAML, YANG, NetConf, OpenConfig, or any of their messy brethren.

## How does it work?

Batfish AI-ML builds on recent advances in Brain Network Interface (BNI). To extract intent, network engineers simply don the Batfish AI-ML helmet while thinking about their network intents. For best results, we recommend shaved (or bald) heads.

When linked with the [Batfish intent validation framework](http://www.batfish.org/), the Batfish AI-ML helmet can send Slack notifications to users’ manager with a pass/fail status of each intent. The managers can also configure Batfish AI-ML to deliver a low-voltage shock for each intent that is violated.

## Try it today!

You can order the Batfish AI-ML helmet from our [website](https://www.batfish.org/) or leading online retailers.

If you buy this week, your helmet will be upgraded for free to support new and exciting features coming down the pipeline, such as:

- Advanced filtering to separate network intents from unrelated thoughts
- A multi-user mode that reconciles conflicting network intents.
- Functioning on top of a tinfoil hat, which network engineers wear as a safety precaution
